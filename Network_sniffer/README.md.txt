# Basic Network Sniffer

## Description
This project is a basic network sniffer built using Python. 
It captures network packets and displays important information 
such as source IP, destination IP, and protocol type.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Socket Programming
- Scapy 

## Features
- Captures live packets
- Displays IP addresses
- Identifies protocols

## Purpose of the Project

This project helps to understand how data flows on a network and how network packets are structured. 
By capturing live packets, we can observe:

- How information is broken into packets at the sender side.  
- How packets travel across different layers of the network.  
- How headers and payloads are organized in each packet.  

Understanding these concepts is essential for network analysis, monitoring, and cybersecurity.
